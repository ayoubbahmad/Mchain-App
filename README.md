# Mchain-App
This MEAN js application was the result of my year-end project, It is an application to sign files electronically and check validation of those signatures... It can be used as a guarantee to the certificate and diploma given by the institus.

To use this application you have to install nodejs and mongodb locally because this application is not yet deployed
(Check youtube for this... it's easy :D).

Then you can clone this repository

Open a terminal on the cloned folder and execute thid command "npm install" then wait for a few seconds to install all necessary packeges

When all packages are installed you can execute this command "nodemon" to start the nodejs server.

Then go to the angular-src folder and open a terminal on it and execute this command "ng serve" or "ng build".

the "ng serve" command will allow you to run the frontend on the port 4200 and the "ng build" command will allow you to generate the frontend to the server side so you can access to the application from the port 3000

at the end just go to http://localhost:4200 or http://localhost:3000 to use the application
